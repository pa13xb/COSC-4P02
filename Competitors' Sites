  A website that has many of the features we envision. However, the options are not always easily accessible and the site sometimes does not work as you would intend.
  For example, searching for 'BBQ' will give recipes that include BBQ sauce, not just recipes that are cooked on the BBQ.
  They also do not have any dedicated way to search by cookware, and many of the filters such as regional cooking or diet cooking do not allow you to search with
  any other features at the same time. So it is a 'one feature at a time' system, which we would like to overcome.
