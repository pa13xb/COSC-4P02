Project Summary

While several recipe sharing websites exist currenlty, our app seeks to make the process of finding great recipies easier for users. Our app aims to solve the issues that plague many of these existing services, like having bloated pages with content not relevent to the recipe, or having recipies that require specific tools or ingredients. Having a streamlined experience that allows users to find recipies based on their available ingredients and cooking appliances/tools quickly and easily without frills will be the draw for our app.
