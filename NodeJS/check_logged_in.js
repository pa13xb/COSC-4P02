/** This file should return a function that checks the cookies to see whether the user is logged in. This file will likely be 'required' by a few other nodeJS scripts.
For example, someone logged in should not be able to even access the "register" form. The less the server has to check for cookies, the better. If the issue can
be resolved by the client checking cookies, let them do it instead. Have to research how cookies work with NodeJS. Express is helpful for it apparently.**/
